HOW TO INSTALL:

- Unzip in "modules" directory.
- Configure this module in admin section.
- Check module environment in the photo album admin section.
- Create a Categories in the photo album admin section.
- If you didnot set, chmod 777 your xoops uploads directory.
- If your server runs "safe_mode on", create photos & thumbs directory manually.
- Start uploading photos! :)




HOW TO UPGRADE (from older myAlbum-P or myAlbum 1.1.3):
- Unzip in "modules" directory.
- Update this module in module administration.
- Set photos/thumbs directories properly in myAlbum-P's admin.
  (If you used daniel's myalbum, photos directory may be /modules/myalbum/photos and thumbnails directory may be /modules/myalbum/photos/thumbs)
- chmod 777 (or 707) photos and photos/thumbs directories (if needed)
- If you used custom template set, remake myalbum_photo.html and myalbum_photo_in_list.html

Don't forget updating this module !

Since some permissioning system has been changed, you should recheck each group's permissions from "Global Permissions" in myAlbum-P's admin, after updating this module.






HOW TO use myAlbum-P multiply

copy the directory of modules/myalbum/ into modules/myalbum* entirely.
(Symbolic linking will not be useful. Because __FILE__ returns true file path.)

The directory names are usable like this:

myalbum0
myalbum1
myalbum2

Thus, you can use 4 of myAlbum-P at same time.
If you want to use more myAlbum-P's as separated modules, use mk_templates.sh and mk_slogo.sh, and edit sql/myalbum*.sql manually.

The important notice: the 1st one should not be older than 2.7.
If you've already use myAlbum-P 2.6x or older, update it at first.



HOW TO use imagemanager integration:

There are two ways to integrate XOOPS imagemanager.

1) overwrite imagemanager.php by modules/myalbum/imagemanager.php
This is the easiest way, but is not smart.

2) add a line into original imagemanager.php like this:
line 28:
---------------------------------------------------
include './mainfile.php';
include 'modules/myalbum/imagemanager.php';  // add this line
if (!isset($HTTP_GET_VARS['target']) && !isset($HTTP_POST_VARS['target'])) {
	exit();
}
---------------------------------------------------
Though this way is a little bit more difficult than overwriting method,
you can turn on/off myalbum's hook easily.

When you use myAlbum-P with multiple, you can specify the module like this:

include 'modules/myalbum0/imagemanager.php';  // add this line

If you want to use ImageManager Integration as Simplified Attachment Manager, change the preferences of myAlbum-P.

eg) If you want to upload and attach PDFs via ImageManager:
- Enable ImageManager Integration like described above.
- set 'jpg|jpeg|gif|png|pdf' in "File extensions can be uploaded"
- set blank as "MIME Types can be uploaded"





enjoy!
