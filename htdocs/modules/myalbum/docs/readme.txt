myAlbum-P is yet another photo album module for XOOPS2.
This module was made with a slogan "Easy to use for even the beginners".

Since myAlbum-P can be used with multi purpose, you can easily install this module multiplly.

Especially, ImageManager integration is useful for almost all XOOPS users.
This feature makes that almost XOOPS modules can treat auto-resized & auto-thumnails-made images by imagemanager.
Of course, auto-created thumnails are used in selecting images and in the artile body, though the thumnail in the article body has a link to the main bigger images.

In myAlbum-P 2.84, ImageManager Integration can treat non-image files. (Simplified Attachment Manager Integration)
This means that you can attach any type of files (PDF, Excel, Word ... yes!) into almost all modules which have XoopsDhtmlTextarea.

"myAlbum-P is not a hacked module."
Although myAlbum-P started from a debugging version of daniel's myAlbum 1.1.3 historically,
codes of the recent version has very little relation to daniel's myAlbum.

Of course, I know myAlbum-P uses images from daniel's myAlbum.
This is the reason why I never eliminate daniel's name and URL from credit or footer.

I maintain myAlbum-P whose table's structures are fully compatible with myAlbum 1.1.3.
But I know that this limitation prevents myAlbum-P from better improvement too.

If I could, I'd like to make another photo album module fully independent with myAlbum.
